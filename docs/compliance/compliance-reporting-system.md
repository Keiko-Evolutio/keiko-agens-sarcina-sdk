## Compliance Scoring

### Scoring Methodology
```
Compliance Score = (Σ(Control Score × Weight)) / Total Possible Score × 100

Where:

- Weight: Importance factor for the control
- Total Possible Score: Maximum achievable score
```

### Score Interpretation
- **95-100**: Excellent compliance posture
- **90-94**: Good compliance with minor gaps
- **80-89**: Acceptable compliance, improvement needed
- **70-79**: Poor compliance, significant gaps
- **Below 70**: Critical compliance issues

### Violation Severity
- **Critical**: Immediate regulatory risk, requires urgent action
- **High**: Significant compliance gap, action needed within 30 days
- **Medium**: Moderate risk, action needed within 90 days
- **Low**: Minor gap, improvement recommended

## Automated Workflows
